        "\n",
        "The five key concepts of Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) are:\n",
        "\n",
        "1. **Encapsulation**:\n",
        "   - This concept involves bundling the data (attributes) and methods (functions) that operate on the data into a single unit or class. It restricts access to certain details of an object and only allows controlled access through methods, ensuring data security and integrity.\n",
        "\n",
        "2. **Abstraction**:\n",
        "   - Abstraction simplifies complex systems by hiding the internal implementation details and exposing only the necessary parts. This allows users to interact with objects without needing to understand the underlying complexity.\n",
        "\n",
        "3. **Inheritance**:\n",
        "   - Inheritance enables new classes (called subclasses or derived classes) to inherit attributes and methods from an existing class (called a superclass or base class). This promotes code reuse and the creation of hierarchical relationships between classes.\n",
        "\n",
        "4. **Polymorphism**:\n",
        "   - Polymorphism allows objects of different classes to be treated as objects of a common superclass. It enables the use of a single method name to perform different types of actions based on the object that is invoking the method. This can be achieved through method overriding and method overloading.\n",
        "\n",
        "5. **Classes and Objects**:\n",
        "   - A **class** is a blueprint for creating objects, defining a set of attributes and methods that the objects created from the class will have. An **object** is an instance of a class, and it represents a specific entity with the characteristics and behaviors defined by the class.\n",
        "\n",
        "These concepts form the foundation of OOP and provide mechanisms for building modular, reusable, and maintainable code."

        "The **Method Resolution Order (MRO)** is the order in which Python looks for a method or attribute in a hierarchy of classes during inheritance. It determines the sequence of classes that Python follows when searching for a method. MRO is especially important in the case of **multiple inheritance**, where a class may inherit from more than one parent class.\n",

        "1. **Private Attributes (`__balance` and `__account_number`)**:\n",

        "- **`__str__`**: This method is used to define a \"user-friendly\" string representation of an object. It is called by the built-in `str()` function and when you use `print()` on an object.\n",
        "- **`__repr__`**: This method is intended to provide an \"official\" string representation of an object that can ideally be used to recreate the object using `eval()`. It is called by the built-in `repr()` function and when you inspect an object in the interactive interpreter.\n",
        "### Explanation:\n",

Ideally, it should be possible to recreate the object by passing the string to `eval()` (though this is not always feasible).\n",

        "\n",
        "\n",
        "In Python, a **decorator** is a function that takes another function as an argument, extends or modifies its behavior, and returns a new function. You can create a decorator to measure and print the execution time of a function using the `time` module.\n",
        "\n",
        "Here's how you can implement a simple execution time decorator:\n",
        "### Explanation:\n",
        "\n",
        "1. **Decorator Function (`execution_time_decorator`)**:\n",
        "   - This function takes another function (`func`) as an argument and defines a nested function (`wrapper`).\n",
        "   - Inside `wrapper`, the start time is recorded using `time.time()` before calling the original function.\n",
        "   - After the function call, the end time is recorded, and the execution time is calculated by subtracting the start time from the end time.\n",
        "   - The execution time is printed, and the result of the original function is returned.\n",
        "\n",
        "2. **Using the Decorator**:\n",
        "   - The `@execution_time_decorator` syntax above the `example_function` definition applies the decorator to the function.\n",
        "   - When you call `example_function`, it will automatically invoke the `wrapper` function, which measures and prints the execution time\n",
        "### Benefits of Using Decorators:\n",
        "- **Code Reusability**: You can easily reuse the decorator to measure execution time for multiple functions without modifying their implementations.\n",
        "- **Separation of Concerns**: It separates the concern of measuring execution time from the actual logic of the function, keeping your code clean and focused.\n"

        "\n",
        "The **Diamond Problem** is a common issue that arises in multiple inheritance scenarios in object-oriented programming languages. It occurs when a class inherits from two classes that both inherit from a common superclass. The name comes from the diamond shape that the inheritance diagram resembles.\n",
        "\n",
        "### The Problem:\n",
        "\n",
        "When class `D` tries to access a method or attribute defined in class `A`, it becomes ambiguous whether the method or attribute should be inherited from class `B` or class `C`. This ambiguity is known as the **Diamond Problem**.\n",
        "\n",
        "### Python’s Resolution of the Diamond Problem:\n",
        "\n",
        "Python uses the **C3 Linearization Algorithm (C3 superclass linearization)** to resolve the diamond problem. This algorithm creates a method resolution order (MRO) that determines the order in which classes are searched for methods and attributes. Here’s how it works:\n",
        "\n",
        "1. **Linearization**: The algorithm builds a linearization of the class hierarchy that respects the order of inheritance and ensures that each class appears before its parents in the linearization.\n",
        "\n",
        "2. **MRO (Method Resolution Order)**: The MRO can be retrieved for any class in Python using the `mro()` method or the `__mro__` attribute. This gives you the order in which Python will look for methods.\n",
        "\n",
        "### Example Code:\n",
        "\n",
        "Here’s an example demonstrating the Diamond Problem and how Python resolves it:\n",
        "\n",
        "```pyth\n",
        "### Explanation of the Code:\n",
        "\n",
        "1. **Class Definitions**:\n",
        "   - Classes `A`, `B`, and `C` are defined, with `B` and `C` both inheriting from `A`.\n",
        "   - Class `D` inherits from both `B` and `C`.\n",
        "\n",
        "2. **Calling `show()`**:\n",
        "   - When you create an instance of `D` and call the `show()` method, Python looks for the method in the order defined by the MRO.\n",
        "   - Since `B` appears before `C` in the MRO, the method from `B` is called, resulting in the output \"Method from B\".\n",
        "\n",
        "3. **Method Resolution Order**:\n",
        "   - The `mro()` method and `__mro__` attribute show the order of classes that Python will use when searching for methods: `D`, `B`, `C`, `A`, and finally `object`.\n",
        "\n",
        "### Summary:\n",
        "- The Diamond Problem can cause ambiguity in multiple inheritance scenarios.\n",
        "- Python resolves the Diamond Problem using the C3 Linearization algorithm, providing a clear and consistent method resolution order (MRO).\n",
